During this second week, I have continued to advance in familiarizing myself with the technologies used in the Unibotics platform.

For the majority of the time, I have focused on learning to develop with React with all what I learned last week about JavaScript. I have learned the main functionalities and have developed a webpage interface for a fictitious consultancy that offers full website creation services to other companies, implementing various React functionalities.

Additionally, during the remaining time, I have a reading of the developer documentation available in the platform's repository. Here, I have primarily studied the project's main features, the general directory structure, and the operation of the computer farm.
