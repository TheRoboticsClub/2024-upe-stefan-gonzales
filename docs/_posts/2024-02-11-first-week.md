In this first week, I've taken my first steps into JdeRobot by getting to know my internship colleagues and familiarizing myself with the technologies used for their platform Unibotics for robotics learning.

To begin with, I've started learning Docker to become acquainted with platform deployment. I've watched tutorials on YouTube to understand how containers, images and volumes work, along with their respective commands for management, as well as Docker-Compose to facilitate communication between different containers within the same environment.

Furthermore, I've learned about Github to effectively engage in collaborative development with the team. Additionally, I've studied the complete architecture of the platform and how different technologies communicate with each other through a document provided by my mentor.

In conclusion, by the end of the week, I've created this blog to document my progress each week and have begun familiarizing myself with JavaScript, as my proficiency in frontend development is limited, in order to learn and master React.
