During this third week, I have started learning how to develop within the Unibotics platform.

Throughout the week, I have learned how to deploy the developer's platform locally (D1). This allows me to develop new functionalities or modify existing ones and verify that they work correctly without affecting the platform launched by the web server, which is the one used by the users.

After having the D1 deployment operational, I have been making small modifications to the platform, such as changing the color of some interface elements or altering the font and size of some text. This has helped me learn how to modify functionalities and see them reflected locally on the platform.

Finally, I have conducted a brief analysis of how the platform's database works, which uses PostgreSQL, and how it utilizes Dash technology to visualize graphs of different activities performed by users by collecting data from within the database.
