During this fourth week, I have started learning how graph visualization works within the Unibotics platform.

Throughout the week, I have delved deeper into learning Dash technology, which the platform uses to represent various activities performed by registered users, such as total connection time and total time spent on robotics exercises, etc.

To create these graphs, the platform retrieves data from the user database, where it is programmed to continuously store all time values for each activity performed. By collecting all this data, it processes it to generate different graphs for each user or collectively.

I have been analyzing this technology both in the production deployment (D3) and in the local deployment (D1) to understand how it behaves when processing user data.
